-add functions to function scope/call functions from var table?
-fix function signatures
-support return keyword in signature
-mark expression as not to be evaluated
-track custom type names alongside basename for extra points
-functions called during instantiation? because of stupid expression evaluation
-double parens required for nested function calls like: f = {n:number} => ((f(n-1)) + (f(n-2)))
-need to handle unknown functions in expressions as well
-memoization
