There are two types of generics here

f = {x:T, y:T} => ...

and

f = {x:(T,T)} => ...

Cases:
f = {x:T, xs: [T]}
f = {x:(T,S), y:S}

Matching can assign n generics, that happens in the type satisfaction function
This should return a pair of (satisfaction:#, generics:[])

These generics should be persisted between arguments but not cases unless the case is winning
